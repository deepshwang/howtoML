# How to manage large-scale / multiple ML experiments

## Why this is a MUST

* A good theory itself cannot comprise a good network: EXPERIMENTS over EXPERIMENTS
* A well-organized experiments will
  * save you so much time
  * help you find better network architecture
  * Easier to write papers later on
* Remind yourself: There must be countless experiments behind works from other papers that looks like it worked well by the theory itself.

(To-Do): What I've learned & will implement
(Ing): What I am already using

## What to set-up before starting experiments of a project

1. Global set-up of environments using docker images & docker hub (Ing)

2. Data visualization tools (Ing)

3. Training progress visualization tools (Ing, but not good enough)

## How to organize your experiment procedures

'asdf'

1. Store configuration for every experiment as a single configuration file (yaml / json)
